# Public Folder

This folder contains the static assets and client-side code for the chat application.

## Structure

- `client.js`: The main JavaScript file that initializes the Feathers client and handles the client-side logic for the chat application.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the chat application.
- `locales/`: This directory contains localization files for different languages.
  - `en/`: English translations.
  - `pt-BR/`: Brazilian Portuguese translations.
  - `pt/`: Portuguese translations.
  - `es/`: Spanish translations.

## Localization

The `locales` directory contains JSON files for different languages to support internationalization. Each JSON file includes translations for various text elements used in the chat application.

## Usage

To use the assets in this folder, ensure that your server is configured to serve static files from the `public` directory. The `index.html` file will be the main entry point for users accessing the chat application.

## Example

To start the chat application, open `index.html` in a web browser. The application will automatically load the necessary scripts and styles, and initialize the Feathers client to connect to the server.
